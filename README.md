# Fundamentals-of-Signals-and-Systems-
This repository contains MATLAB code and documentation for a real-time image-processing project completed for ECE 3500 – Signal and Systems at the University of Utah. The project demonstrates Gaussian blurring, Wiener deconvolution, and frequency-domain image restoration using concepts from Fourier transforms.

## Project Overview
  The goal of this project is to explore frequency-domain image processing to:
  * Blur an image using a Gaussian point spread function (PSF)
  * Restore the blurred image using Wiener deconvolution
  * Analyze the effect of Gaussian filter parameters (σ), noise variance, and sharpening
  * Demonstrate practical applications of Fourier transforms for image noise reduction and restoration
  A webcam-captured image is blurred in the frequency domain and later restored in an attempt to recover sharpness while mitigating noise.
